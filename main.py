<h2>What is a Jigsaw</h2>
[box type="info" align="" class="" width=""]It was said to have emerged in the 19th century, but they do not use it without the help of a treadle. The <strong>modern portable jigsaw</strong> didn't come out until 1947 when it was introduced by Scintilla AG, which was later on acquired by the company Bosch.[/box]

Jigsaw can efficiently cut angles up to 45 degrees in making miter joints.
<h2>Jigsaw and how they are used?</h2>
<img class="size-medium wp-image-3631 alignright" src="https://top-buy.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jigsaw-1-300x277.jpg" alt="Jigsaw and how they are used?" width="300" height="277" />Jigsaws are used by<strong> attaching different blade accessory</strong> to it. Bosch was able to make using a jigsaw easier by manufacturing a tool-free blade change system. Previous jigsaw models require a blade screwed on the tool, which complicates using it a bit. Blades include T-shank blades and U-shank blades. The tooth design is also important for the efficiency of this tool.

You can choose a side set and the ground tooth<strong> to provide clean and fast cuts</strong> in plastics and wood while the wavy set and milled teeth can cut through metal, plastic, and aluminum. They introduce another material they can use with the jigsaw, which is the reduced-kerf carbide and diamond grit edges to help cut through hard materials and make the work faster. Using a jigsaw requires knowledge and will need a few trials before you can get it smoothly cutting materials that you like.

Blades of the jigsaw are weak and small since the lower end is <strong>unsupported.</strong> To make sure you get the cut you prefer, they use a blade roller, this will keep the blade aligned above the sole plate. Guiding a jigsaw is not by forcing it to move, but you must steer it, and move sideways instead. Making sure that you have sharp blades all the time is important to get <strong>high-quality cuts.</strong>

<h2>What types of Jigsaw are there?</h2>
<img class="size-medium wp-image-3630 alignleft" src="https://top-buy.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jigsaw-7-300x284.jpg" alt="What types of Jigsaw are there?" width="300" height="284" />There is a corded jigsaw and a cordless jigsaw.

<strong>Corded</strong> - First introduced type of jigsaw with a cord and where the power is from the use of the main electric source where you usually plug it in. Corded jigsaw may differ with the power and energy it can give out. This type, though, may need getting used to since there is a cord that you need to consider while working. It is also not very portable to bring with you anywhere.

<strong>Cordless jigsaw</strong> - Its power is from the battery and, once used up, requires charging. This jigsaw is lightweight and portable, as it is meant to be lighter compared to the corded jigsaw for easy maneuverability. You can bring it with you anywhere without worrying where you need to plug it in as long as you have it fully charged.

Cordless jigsaw is less powerful as compared to the corded one.

<strong>Types of jigsaw according to blades</strong>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Carbon steel Jigsaw blade -</strong> this blade is the most common and can cut through wood and PVC pipes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bi-Metal Jigsaw Blade</strong> - this blade has hardened teeth and is considered more powerful to cut through metal.</li>
 	<li><strong>Carbide Jigsaw Blades</strong> - this blade, on the other hand, can cut through different materials and is considered more powerful and fast.</li>
</ol>
<h2>This is what we check in Jigsaw Reviews</h2>
<img class="size-medium wp-image-3629 alignright" src="https://top-buy.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jigsaw-6-300x295.jpg" alt="This is what we check in Jigsaw Reviews" width="300" height="295" />They invent jigsaws to make <strong>cutting materials fast and effortless</strong>. This will shorten the time of work instead of using the manual tools used previously. However, with tools such as this, we also need to review the materials used in manufacturing, its longevity or durability, the price of the product, and the cleaning process.
<h3>Materials</h3>
Mostly made of stainless steel material plus the blade used can be made of <strong>high-carbon steel</strong> or <strong>high-speed steel.</strong> The bi-metal blade contains both high-carbon steel and high-speed materials. When combined, this will reinforce the tool strongly and creates a blade that has less risk of breakage and has high flexibility plus versatility. Bi-metal has a longer lifespan compared to other blade types.

There is also the material Tungsten carbide, which can cut through any material while <strong>Diamond-grit blades are highly versatile.</strong> Users can decide which to choose, and the length of use will depend on the material as well.
<h3>Longevity</h3>
Tungsten carbide and <strong>Diamond-grit blades</strong> are more durable and highly preferred by more users.
<h3>Price</h3>
The price of the jigsaw will depend on stroke, length, power, and speed. Plus, the blade used and as <strong>many features,</strong> you choose the higher-priced the jigsaw will be.
<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Cleaning the jigsaw is preferred every after use and every replacement of pieces.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keep the jigsaw free</strong> from dust and debris so your jigsaw will not overheat while in use.</li>
 	<li>The handle and other parts must be clean and free of grease so that when handling it, there is no risk of accidents.</li>
 	<li>Removing dirt or grease is done with a clean cloth plus mild soap.</li>
 	<li><strong>Blade guide needs cleaning,</strong> also where an old toothbrush can remove grime and dirt at the same time.</li>
 	<li><strong>Lubrication</strong> is important because your jigsaw will not work efficiently without proper lubrication. [ads2]</li>

<h2>Buying the best Jigsaw</h2>
<img class="size-medium wp-image-3628 alignright" src="https://top-buy.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jigsaw-5-300x253.jpg" alt="Buying the best Jigsaw" width="300" height="253" />With the availability of different branded jigsaw tool, you will have a hard time finding the best one for your needs. Most especially if you are not familiar with it, you can get confused with the features and some terms about the tool.
Here are some reminders when you are b<strong>uying a jigsaw.</strong>
<h3>Instore</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>When you look for a jigsaw, you need to know the <strong>SPM or strokes per minute,</strong> which is the measurement of the maximum speed that is measured in strokes. Or it can be the fastness of the blade which completes a cutting motion in a minute.</li>
 	<li>What amp rating will you need? If you need a jigsaw for light cutting work, then there is a 4-amp motor, which is also inexpensive, but for a higher quality of work, you will need a 7-amp or a higher model, which is also, more expensive.</li>
 	<li><strong>Would you like a corded or cordless jigsaw?</strong> If you are after the portability and convenience of use, then you can go for the cordless type, but if you have no issues working with a corded jigsaw, then get a jigsaw with cord since it will also have more power and is considered heavy duty.</li>
 	<li>Type of blade is another consideration, there are types of the blade, that may cost you more, but it will last you longer, plus it will give you the efficient cutting power that you are looking for.</li>
 	<li>This may not mean much if you are starting with using the tool, but for those who know more, there are 2-types of cutting action, which are straight or orbital. For those who are just after cutting a straight cut, then a straight cutting action is what you need while the orbital cutting action is chosen if you like to make delicate cuts.</li>
 	<li>[box type="info" align="" class="" width=""]Blades are something you need to consider, such as <strong>T-shank or U-shank blades.</strong> If you are to change blades often, you may want to consider a T-shank blade, which is easier to remove and install.[/box]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Online</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>You can only check the specs online and also with the help of the online store seller.</li>
 	<li>Here are some pointers you need to remember when buying jigsaw online.</li>
 	<li>Some features may be a preference, while other features are given more priority.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ask about the variable speed</strong> of the jigsaw you are planning to buy. Contact the seller and ask what speeds of jigsaw do they currently have, at the same time, ask the prices for each so you can get the different brands they sell and compare it.</li>
 	<li>If you need to know which is better to use, whether it is a jigsaw with orbital action or the one with an up-and-down motion jigsaw. Some sellers will also let you in on the style on how you can handle a jigsaw tool well, even if you are just starting with its use.</li>
 	<li><strong>Price</strong> is for your high list of consideration since expensive jigsaw almost always has the features you are looking for, such as the high motor power, the depth of cut, there may also be a laser guideline features and some have a dust blower also which makes cleaning after use easier. <strong>Compare</strong> the prices of each jigsaw that is available at the online store you choose and pick the best one that will cater to your needs.</li>
